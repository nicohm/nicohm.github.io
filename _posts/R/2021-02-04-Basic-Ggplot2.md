#  Basic Ggplot2

[TOC]



## First plot

```R
# Load the ggplot2 package
library('ggplot2')

# Explore the mtcars data frame with str()
str(mtcars)

# Execute the following command
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

 Modify a numeric variable to a categorical variable

```R
# Load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Change the command below so that cyl is treated as factor
ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Aesthetics

### Color

```R
# Edit to add a color aesthetic mapped to disp
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = disp)) +
  geom_point()
```

Shape accepts only categorical variables

## Layers

## Geometries

```R
# Add geom_smooth() with +
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

### Changing one geom or every geom

If you have multiple geoms, then mapping an aesthetic to data variable inside the call to `ggplot()` will change *all* the geoms. It is also possible to make changes to *individual* geoms by passing arguments to the `geom_*()` functions.

`geom_point()` has an `alpha` argument that controls the opacity of the points. A value of `1` (the default) means that the points are totally opaque; a value of `0` means the points are totally transparent (and therefore invisible). Values in between specify transparency.

### Saving plots as variables

Plots can be saved as variables, which can be added two later on using the `+` operator. This is really useful if you want to make multiple related plots from a common base.

```R
# Draw a ggplot
plt_price_vs_carat <- ggplot(
  # Use the diamonds dataset
  diamonds,
  # For the aesthetics, map x to carat and y to price
  aes(carat, price)
)

# Add a point layer to plt_price_vs_carat
plt_price_vs_carat + geom_point()
```

```R
# From previous step
plt_price_vs_carat <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price))

# Edit this to make points 20% opaque: plt_price_vs_carat_transparent
plt_price_vs_carat_transparent <- plt_price_vs_carat + geom_point(alpha = 0.2)

# See the plot
plt_price_vs_carat_transparent
```

```R
# From previous step
plt_price_vs_carat <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price))

# Edit this to map color to clarity,
# Assign the updated plot to a new object
plt_price_vs_carat_by_clarity <- plt_price_vs_carat + geom_point(aes(color = clarity))

# See the plot
plt_price_vs_carat_by_clarity
```

### All about aesthetics: color, shape and size

In the video you saw 9 visible aesthetics. Let's apply them to a categorical variable â€” the cylinders in `mtcars`, `cyl`.

These are the aesthetics you can consider within [`aes()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/aes) in this chapter: `x`, `y`, `color`, `fill`, `size`, `alpha`, `labels` and `shape`.

One common convention is that you don't name the `x` and `y` arguments to `aes()`, since they almost always come first, but you do name other arguments.

In the following exercise the `fcyl` column is categorical. It is `cyl` transformed into a `factor`.

```
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = fcyl)) +
  # Set the shape and size of the points
  geom_point(shape = 1, size = 4)
```

### All about aesthetics: color vs. fill

Typically, the `color` aesthetic changes the *outline* of a geom and the `fill` aesthetic changes the *inside*. `geom_point()` is an exception: you use `color` (not `fill`) for the point color. However, some shapes have special behavior.

The default `geom_point()` uses `shape = 19`: a solid circle. An alternative is `shape = 21`: a circle that allow you to use *both* `fill` for the inside *and* `color` for the outline. This is lets you to map two aesthetics to each point.

All shape values are described on the [`points()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/topics/points) help page.

`fcyl` and `fam` are the `cyl` and `am` columns converted to factors, respectively.

### Comparing aesthetics

```R
# Base layer
plt_mpg_vs_wt <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))

# Map fcyl to shape, not alpha
plt_mpg_vs_wt +
  geom_point(aes(shape = fcyl))
```

```R
# Base layer
plt_mpg_vs_wt <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))

# Use text layer and map fcyl to label
plt_mpg_vs_wt +
  geom_text(aes(label = fcyl))
```

Which aesthetics are only applicable to categorical data?

- label & shape

### All about attributes: color, shape, size and alpha

This time you'll use these arguments to set *attributes* of the plot, not map variables onto *aesthetics*.

You can specify colors in R using **hex codes**: a hash followed by two hexadecimal numbers each for red, green, and blue (`"#RRGGBB"`). Hexadecimal is base-16 counting. You have 0 to 9, and A representing 10 up to F representing 15. Pairs of hexadecimal numbers give you a range from 0 to 255. `"#000000"` is "black" (no color), `"#FFFFFF"` means "white", and `"#00FFFF" is cyan (mixed green and blue).

A hexadecimal color variable, `my_blue` has been defined for you.

```R
# A hexadecimal color
my_blue <- "#4ABEFF"

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  # Set the point color and alpha
  geom_point(color = my_blue, alpha = 0.6)
```

```R
# A hexadecimal color
my_blue <- "#4ABEFF"

# Change the color mapping to a fill mapping
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, fill = fcyl)) +
  # Set point size and shape
  geom_point(color = my_blue, size = 10, shape = 1)
```

### All about attributes: conflicts with aesthetics

In the videos you saw that you can use all the aesthetics as attributes. Let's see how this works with the aesthetics you used in the previous exercises: `x`, `y`, `color`, `fill`, `size`, `alpha`, `label` and `shape`.

In this exercise you will set all kinds of attributes of the points!

You will continue to work with `mtcars`.

```R
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = fcyl)) +
  # Add text layer with label rownames(mtcars) and color red
  geom_text(label = rownames(mtcars), color = "red")
```

### Updating aesthetic labels

In this exercise, you'll modify some aesthetics to make a bar plot of the number of cylinders for cars with different types of transmission.

You'll also make use of some functions for improving the appearance of the plot.

- [`labs()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/topics/labs) to set the x- and y-axis labels. It takes strings for each argument.
- [`scale_color_manual()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/topics/scale_manual) defines properties of the color scale (i.e. axis). The first argument sets the legend title. `values` is a named vector of colors to use.

```R
ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, fill = fam)) +
  geom_bar() +
  # Set the axis labels
  labs(x = "Number of Cylinders",
       y = "Count")
```

```R
palette <- c(automatic = "#377EB8", manual = "#E41A1C")

ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, fill = fam)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Number of Cylinders", y = "Count") +
  # Set the fill color scale
  scale_fill_manual("Transmission", values = palette)
```

```R
palette <- c(automatic = "#377EB8", manual = "#E41A1C")

# Set the position
ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, fill = fam)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Number of Cylinders", y = "Count")
  scale_fill_manual("Transmission", values = palette)
```

### Setting a dummy aesthetic

In the last chapter you saw that all the visible aesthetics can serve as attributes and aesthetics, but I very conveniently left out x and y. That's because although you can make univariate plots (such as histograms, which you'll get to in the next chapter), a y-axis will always be provided, even if you didn't ask for it.

You can make univariate plots in `ggplot2`, but you will need to add a fake y axis by mapping `y` to zero.

When using setting y-axis limits, you can specify the limits as separate arguments, or as a single numeric vector. That is, `ylim(lo, hi)` or `ylim(c(lo, hi))`.

```R
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, 0)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  # Set the y-axis limits
  ylim(-2,2)
```

### Appropriate mappings

Incorrect aesthetic mapping causes confusion or misleads the audience.

Typically, the **dependent** variable is mapped onto the the **y**-axis and the **independent** variable is mapped onto the **x**-axis.

In the `ToothGrowth` data set, we have three variables:

| Variable | Description                |
| :------- | :------------------------- |
| `len`    | Tooth length               |
| `supp`   | Supplement type (VC or OJ) |
| `dose`   | Dose in milligrams/day     |

From the six possible ways to map three variables, one solution is shown in the viewer. Which of the remaining five would actually be a better solution?

## Scatter plots

### Overplotting 1: large datasets

Scatter plots (using `geom_point()`) are intuitive, easily understood, and very common, but we must *always* consider **overplotting**, particularly in the following four situations:

1. Large datasets
2. Aligned values on a single axis
3. Low-precision data
4. Integer data

Typically, *alpha* blending (i.e. adding transparency) is recommended when using solid shapes. Alternatively, you can use opaque, hollow shapes.

Small points are suitable for large datasets with regions of high density (lots of overlapping).

Let's use the `diamonds` dataset to practice dealing with the large dataset case.

### Overplotting 2: Aligned values

Let's take a look at another case where we should be aware of overplotting: Aligning values on a single axis.

This occurs when one axis is continuous and the other is categorical, which can be overcome with some form of jittering.

In the `mtcars` data set, `fam` and `fcyl` are categorical variants of `cyl` and `am`

```R
# Plot base
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg, color = factor(am)))

# Default points are shown for comparison
x11()
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam + geom_point()

# Alter the point positions by jittering, width 0.3
plt_mpg_vs_fcyl_by_fam + geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.3))
```

### Overplotting 3: Low-precision data

You already saw how to deal with overplotting when using [`geom_point()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/geom_point) in two cases:

1. Large datasets
2. Aligned values on a single axis

We used `position = 'jitter'` inside [`geom_point()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/geom_point) or [`geom_jitter()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/geom_jitter).

Let's take a look at another case:

1. Low-precision data

This results from low-resolution measurements like in the iris dataset, which is measured to 1mm precision (see viewer). It's similar to case 2, but in this case we can jitter on both the x and y axis.

```R
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  # Swap for jitter layer with width 0.1
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.1)

# Diferent approach
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  # Set the position to jitter
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, position = "jitter")
```

**EYE: Jitter points to avoid overplotting**

`position_jitter(width = NULL, height = NULL, seed = NA)`

### Overplotting 4: Integer data

Let's take a look at the last case of dealing with overplotting:

1. Integer data

This can be type `integer` (i.e. 1 ,2, 3â€¦) or categorical (i.e. class `factor`) variables. `factor` is just a special class of type `integer`.

You'll typically have a small, defined number of intersections between two variables, which is similar to case 3, but you may miss it if you don't realize that integer and factor data are the same as low precision data.

The `Vocab` dataset provided contains the years of education and vocabulary test scores from respondents to US General Social Surveys from 1972-2004.

```R
ggplot(Vocab, aes(education, vocabulary)) +
  # Change to a jitter layer
  geom_jitter()
```

Notar la diferencia cuando se usa `geom_point()`

## Histograms

### Drawing histograms

Recall that histograms cut up a continuous variable into discrete bins and, by default, maps the internally calculated `count` variable (the number of observations in each bin) onto the y aesthetic. An internal variable called `density` can be accessed by using the `..` notation, i.e. `..density..`. Plotting this variable will show the relative frequency, which is the height times the width of each bin.

```
# Plot mpg
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg)) +
  # Add a histogram layer
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

```R
# Map y to ..density..
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

```
datacamp_light_blue <- "#51A8C9"

ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, ..density..)) +
  # Set the fill color to datacamp_light_blue
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = datacamp_light_blue)
```

### Positions in histograms

Here, we'll examine the various ways of applying positions to histograms. [`geom_histogram()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/geom_histogram), a special case of [`geom_bar()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/geom_bar), has a `position` argument that can take on the following values:

- `stack` (the default): Bars for different groups are stacked on top of each other.
- `dodge`: Bars for different groups are placed side by side.
- `fill`: Bars for different groups are shown as proportions.
- `identity`: Plot the values as they appear in the dataset.

```
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, fill = fam)) +
  # Change the position to dodge
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "dodge")
```

```R
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, fill = fam)) +
  # Change the position to identity, with transparency 0.4
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "identity", alpha = 0.4)
```

## Bar Plots

### Position in bar and col plots

Let's see how the `position` argument changes [`geom_bar()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/geom_bar).

We have three position options:

- `stack`: The default
- `dodge`: Preferred
- `fill`: To show proportions

While we will be using `geom_bar()` here, note that the function [`geom_col()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/geom_col) is just `geom_bar()` where both the `position` and `stat` arguments are set to `"identity"`. It is used when we want the heights of the bars to represent the exact values in the data.

In this exercise, you'll draw the total count of cars having a given number of cylinders (`fcyl`), according to manual or automatic transmission type (`fam`).

```R
ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, fill = fam)) +
  # Set the position to "fill"
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

### Overlapping bar plots

You can customize bar plots further by adjusting the dodging so that your bars partially overlap each other. Instead of using `position = "dodge"`, you're going to use `position_dodge()`, like you did with `position_jitter()` in the the previous exercises. Here, you'll save this as an object, `posn_d`, so that you can easily reuse it.

Remember, the reason you want to use `position_dodge()` (and `position_jitter()`) is to specify *how much* dodging (or jittering) you want.

For this example, you'll use the `mtcars` dataset.

```
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, fill = fam)) +
  # Change position to use the functional form, with width i0.2
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(width = 0.2))
# With transparency
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, fill = fam)) +
  # Set the transparency to 0.6
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(width = 0.2), alpha = 0.6)
```

### Bar plots: sequential color palette

In this bar plot, we'll fill each segment according to an ordinal variable. The best way to do that is with a sequential color palette.

Here's an example of using a sequential color palette with the `mtcars` dataset:

```
ggplot(mtcars, aes(fcyl, fill = fam)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

In the exercise, you'll use similar code on the the `Vocab` dataset. Both datasets are **ordinal**.

```R
# Plot education, filled by vocabulary
ggplot(Vocab, aes(education, fill = vocabulary)) +
  # Add a bar layer with position "fill"
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  # Add a brewer fill scale with default palette
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

## Line plots

### Basic line plots

Here, we'll use the `economics` dataset to make some line plots. The dataset contains a time series for unemployment and population statistics from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in the United States. The data is contained in the `ggplot2` package.

To begin with, you can look at how the median unemployment time and the unemployment rate (the number of unemployed people as a proportion of the population) change over time.

### Multiple time series

We already saw how the form of your data affects how you can plot it. Let's explore that further with multiple time series. Here, it's important that all lines are on the same scale, and if possible, on the same plot.

`fish.species` contains the global capture rates of seven salmon species from 1950â€“2010. Each variable (column) is a Salmon species and each observation (row) is one year. `fish.tidy` contains the same data, but in three columns: `Species`, `Year`, and `Capture` (i.e. one variable per column).

```
# Plot the Rainbow Salmon time series
ggplot(fish.species, aes(x = Year, y = Rainbow)) +
  geom_line()

# Plot the Pink Salmon time series
ggplot(fish.species, aes(Year, Pink)) +
  geom_line()
```

OJo: aquÃ­ la data tiene forma larga:

```
# Plot the Rainbow Salmon time series
ggplot(fish.species, aes(x = Year, y = Rainbow)) +
  geom_line()

# Plot the Pink Salmon time series
ggplot(fish.species, aes(x = Year, y = Pink)) +
  geom_line()

# Plot multiple time-series by grouping by species
ggplot(fish.tidy, aes(Year, Capture)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Species))
```

## Themes for scratch 

### Moving the legend

Let's wrap up this course by making a publication-ready plot communicating a clear message.

To change stylistic elements of a plot, call [`theme()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/theme) and set plot properties to a new value. For example, the following changes the legend position.

```R
p + theme(legend.position = new_value)
```

Here, the new value can be

- `"top"`, `"bottom"`, `"left"`, or `"right'"`: place it at that side of the plot.
- `"none"`: don't draw it.
- `c(x, y)`: `c(0, 0)` means the bottom-left and `c(1, 1)` means the top-right.

Let's revisit the recession period line plot (assigned to `plt_prop_unemployed_over_time`).

### Modifying theme elements

Many plot elements have multiple properties that can be set. For example, line elements in the plot such as axes and gridlines have a color, a thickness (`size`), and a line type (solid line, dashed, or dotted). To set the style of a line, you use [`element_line()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/topics/margin). For example, to make the axis lines into red, dashed lines, you would use the following.

```R
p + theme(axis.line = element_line(color = "red", linetype = "dashed"))
```

Similarly, `element_rect()` changes rectangles and `element_text()` changes text. You can remove a plot element using `element_blank()`.

`plt_prop_unemployed_over_time` is available.

```
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme(
    # For all rectangles, set the fill color to grey92
    rect = element_rect(fill = "grey92"),
    # For the legend key, turn off the outline
    legend.key = element_rect(color= NA))
```

```R
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme(
    rect = element_rect(fill = "grey92"),
    legend.key = element_rect(color = NA),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(
      color = "white",
      size = 0.5,
      linetype = "dotted"
    ),
    # Set the axis text color to grey25
    axis.text = element_text(color = "grey25"),
    # Set the plot title font face to italic and font size to 16
   plot.title = element_text(
       size = 16, 
       face = "italic")
  )
```

### Modifying whitespace

**Whitespace** means all the non-visible margins and spacing in the plot.

To set a single whitespace value, use [`unit(x, unit)`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grid/topics/unit), where `x` is the amount and `unit` is the unit of measure.

Borders require you to set 4 positions, so use [`margin(top, right, bottom, left, unit)`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/topics/margin). To remember the margin order, think **TRouBLe**.

The default unit is `"pt"` (points), which scales well with text. Other options include "cm", "in" (inches) and "lines" (of text).

`plt_mpg_vs_wt_by_cyl` is available. The panel and legend are wrapped in blue boxes so you can see how they change.

```
# View the original plot
plt_mpg_vs_wt_by_cyl

plt_mpg_vs_wt_by_cyl +
  theme(
    # Set the axis tick length to 2 lines
    axis.ticks.length = unit(2, "lines")
  )
```

```
plt_mpg_vs_wt_by_cyl +
  theme(
    # Set the legend key size to 3 centimeters
    legend.key.size = unit(3, "cm")
  )
```

```
plt_mpg_vs_wt_by_cyl +
  theme(
    # Set the legend margin to (20, 30, 40, 50) points
    legend.margin = margin(20, 30, 40, 50, "pt")
  )
```

## Themes

### Built-in themes

In addition to making your own themes, there are several [out-of-the-box solutions](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) that may save you lots of time.

- [`theme_gray()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/ggtheme) is the default.
- [`theme_bw()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/ggtheme) is useful when you use transparency.
- [`theme_classic()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/ggtheme) is more traditional.
- [`theme_void()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/functions/ggtheme) removes everything but the data.

`plt_prop_unemployed_over_time` is available.

```
# Add a classic theme
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_classic()
```

### Exploring ggthemes

Outside of `ggplot2`, another source of built-in themes is the `ggthemes` package. The workspace already contains the `plt_prop_unemployed_over_time`, the line plot from before. Let's explore some of the ready-made `ggthemes` themes.

`plt_prop_unemployed_over_time` is available.

```R
# Use the fivethirtyeight theme
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

Other themes: wsj, tufte

### Setting themes

Reusing a theme across many plots helps to provide a consistent style. You have several options for this.

1. Assign the theme to a variable, and add it to each plot.
2. Set your theme as the default using [`theme_set()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/topics/theme_get).

A good strategy that you'll use here is to begin with a built-in theme then modify it.

`plt_prop_unemployed_over_time` is available. The theme you made earlier is shown in the sample code.

```
theme_recession <- theme(
  rect = element_rect(fill = "grey92"),
  legend.key = element_rect(color = NA),
  axis.ticks = element_blank(),
  panel.grid = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "white", size = 0.5, linetype = "dotted"),
  axis.text = element_text(color = "grey25"),
  plot.title = element_text(face = "italic", size = 16),
  legend.position = c(0.6, 0.1)
)
theme_tufte_recession <- theme_tufte() + theme_recession

# Set theme_tufte_recession as the default theme
theme_set(theme_tufte_recession)

# Draw the plot (without explicitly adding a theme)
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time
```

### Publication-quality plots

We've seen many examples of beautiful, publication-quality plots. Let's take a final look and put all the pieces together.

`plt_prop_unemployed_over_time` is available.

```
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_tufte() +
  # Add individual theme elements
  theme(
    # Turn off the legend
    legend.position = "none",
    # Turn off the axis ticks
    axis.ticks = element_blank()
  )
```

```
plt_prop_unemployed_over_time +
  theme_tufte() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_text(color = "grey60"),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "grey60"),
    # Set the panel gridlines major y values
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(
      # Set the color to grey60
      color = "grey60",
      # Set the size to 0.25
      size = 0.25,
      # Set the linetype to dotted
      linetype = "dotted"
    )
  )
```

### Using geoms for explanatory plots

Let's focus on producing beautiful and effective explanatory plots. In the next couple of exercises, you'll create a plot that is similar to the one shown in the video using `gm2007`, a filtered subset of the `gapminder` dataset.

This type of plot will be in an info-viz style, meaning that it would be similar to something you'd see in a magazine or website for a mostly lay audience.

A scatterplot of `lifeExp` by `country`, colored by `lifeExp`, with points of size `4`, is provided.

```
# Add a geom_segment() layer
ggplot(gm2007, aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, color = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = 30, yend = country), size = 2)
```

`xend = 30` significa que 30 es la esperanza de  vida de inicio del eje X (valor de inicio)

```
# Set the color scale
palette <- brewer.pal(5, "RdYlBu")[-(2:4)]

# Modify the scales

### Using annotate() for embellishments

In the previous exercise, we completed our basic plot. Now let's polish it by playing with the theme and adding annotations. In this exercise, you'll use `annotate()` to add text and a curve to the plot.

The following values have been calculated for you to assist with adding embellishments to the plot:

```
global_mean <- mean(gm2007_full$lifeExp)
x_start <- global_mean + 4
y_start <- 5.5
x_end <- global_mean
y_end <- 7.5
```

Our previous plot has been assigned to `plt_country_vs_lifeExp`.
